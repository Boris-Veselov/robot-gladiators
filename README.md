## Description

A combat simulator game called Robot Gladiators. During the game, players will coach their robot through a series of fightsâ€”gaining cash, attack power, and repairs along the way. The robot that survives with the most cash will be remembered in the browser's storage system. This is an MVP, a minimal viable product.
